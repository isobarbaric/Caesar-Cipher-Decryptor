### Description for this Project

Caesar-Cipher Decryptor provides a way to crack caesar ciphers instantly! 

Looping around and about the alphabet, this decryptor generates all possible decryptions algorithmically and harnesses the power of a web scraper to validate such decryptions! Given a certain encryption, 26 circular decryptions are generated by an algorithm and are subject to a further validity test. Using a web-scraper, the validity of the generated possibilities is determined by their existence in a dictionary. If a specific word exists, it is undoubtedly a valid word, and the contrapositive holds true as well.

Finally, as a cherry on top, PHP on the back-end and retro-themed CSS on the front end provides a one-of-a-kind user experience!

The motivation for this project comes from an elaborate presentation on cryptography given in my AP CS A class (ICS4U) by two of my colleagues (Jason and Matthew). The fun guess-the-decryption activity near the end of their presentation laid the groundwork for this project!

### Try It Out Yourself!

Running a live server with PHP will render this website! To do this, run the following command to start a local PHP server at port 8000 (the local port can be changed to any of your liking, of course).

```
    php -S localhost:8000
```
